# ha-react-dashboard

Goal: Use https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-strategy/ to configure a dashboard, not with yaml, but JSX/TSX.

In my case, I want to do something like https://github.com/AalianKhan/mushroom-strategy, but with React and my own config/cards.

## Development

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```
